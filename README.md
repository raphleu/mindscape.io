A social media platform where people build content in the form of a directed graph of Notes, Presents, and Defines. The intent is to provide an interface that resembles reality more accurately.


A Note is a post that resembles an object. It sits in space and can be moved around, via selection and click-commands or by drag and drop. The content of a Note can/should be made immutable. Notes are nodes in the graph.


A Define relationship links two Notes as an arrow between the top-left corner of each Note. It implies that the meaning of the target Note depends on the meaning of the source Note. These are used to arrange the Notes into a tree-like structure from specific Notes to abstract Notes. All Define relationships written by the user must be part of some path of Define relationships that end in that user's Author Note. Each Define relationship represents a unit of the user's cognitive function.


Notes are nested within one another in the interface. The outermost Note for each user is their Author Note. Each Note displays its contents in a resizable plane. The content Notes can be listed like in traditional social media to increase density. Recursively nested Notes form outlines. The relationship from container to component is the Present relationship. Present relationships form a tree rooted at the Author Note.


When a new Note is written, it automatically receives a Present relationship from its container Note, and a Define relationship to that container Note.


Present relationships can be redrawn automatically based on Define relationships, to re-outline specific Notes according to different abstractions. For instance, I might add Notes in a journal format, where the Notes are nested in a time tree (Defined from day to month to year; Presented from year to month to day). As I add Notes into the hierarchy of time units, I might use them to Define other Notes in my ontology, for instance a work tree (Defined from task to project to mission). Then I could use a control on the mission Note to re-outline these Notes by topic.


The service will provide public 4 types of coordinate Notes, based geometrically on timestamp, longitude, latitude, and altitude. On commit, each Note will automatically Define the public Notes that correspond with the user's position.
These Notes will serve as the initial connection points that allow users to browse public Notes of other users. Users can create abstractions for these public coordinate notes, such as cities and seasons.


Users can draw Define relationships/links between Notes they did not write.
By creating a cycle of Define relationships, a user indicates the equivalence of Notes. The service will provide aggregate Defines to give some impression of the flow across popular Notes.


Changes made by a user are streamed in realtime to other users that have access to that Note. If multiple users have Notes in the same container, those Notes will act as the users' avatars in an MMO. Uncommitted notes will be used for instant message style, ephemeral chat. A school or a company can use an internally shared Note as a virtual blackboard or meeting room.


Users can tip other users or subscribe to them using built in payment systems. Users can buy or subscribe to skins, hats, other cosmetic doodads. Popular writers should be able to sustain themselves on income from subscriptions.


Machine learning will be applied to play the role of teacher or enzyme, linking together related (including anti-related) Notes, promoting interaction between users based on the content they publish. 


A user's hierarchy of Notes can be regarded as a mailbox tree. Instead of relying on the receiver to organize his inbox, the sender can take on some of that burden by addressing his message to the receiver's closest abstraction to it.


A government can build a tree of issues that users will coordinate on to build citizenship profiles with corresponding responses to those issues. Instead of one-off voting, democracy will be enacted via a persistent engagement and interaction between different authors.


Instead of evaluating students based only on multiple choice tests and essays, colleges can evaluate them according to a portfolio of content and organization.

Users can animate the change of their graph over time.

Users can write queries to investigate the graph database directly.

Users can use the app to develop software.

Users can view external web pages inside of Notes.

Users can use VR to set up 3D visualizations of the Internet.
